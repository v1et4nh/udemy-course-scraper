# udemy-course-scraper
Get all free udemy courses with only one click at mydealz ;)

Problems:
- Some courses added to cart are still not discounted although it was free when clicking the "add to cart"-button
- Later on in the for-loop, it seems to be laggy... the button is not clickable in time, so the script added it, but actually missed it

Get all free udemy courses with only one click at mydealz ;)

Adjust the mydealz-page within main.py. <br>
Start main.py. <br>
The script will automatically put all free udemy courses listed on that mydealz-page into cart. <br>
At the end of the script you can login and "purchase" them all at once. <br>

Some Problems unsolved:
- Some courses added to cart are still not discounted although it was free when clicking the "add to cart"-button
- Later on in the for-loop, it seems to be laggy... the button is not clickable in time, so the script added it, but actually missed it

I am happy about your contribution!

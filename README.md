# udemy-course-scraper
This script adds all free udemy courses listed at mydealz to cart with only one click ;)
Can be run in the background.

<h2> How to Start </h2>
- Adjust the mydealz_page within main.py. <br>
- Start main.py. <br>
- The script will automatically put all free udemy courses listed on that mydealz-page into cart. <br>
- At the end of the script you can login and "purchase" them all at once. <br>

<h2> Some Problems unsolved </h2>
- Some courses added to cart are still not discounted although it was free when clicking the "add to cart"-button <br>
- Later on in the for-loop, it seems to be laggy... the button is not clickable in time, so the script added it, but actually missed it <br>
- Chrome is not working at the moment, only Firefox. For Firefox make sure to add the folder "Geckodriver" to your PATH. <br>
